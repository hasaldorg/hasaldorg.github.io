<p><strong>Date:&nbsp; Thursday, 25 May 2017</strong><br><strong>Speakers: Timothy Mossman from Simon Fraser University</strong></p>



<p>This was an overview of the services the SLC at SFU provides to shape student success: workshops, consultations, print and online resources, as well as through classroom collaborations with faculty.&nbsp; Tim described their unique multi-tiered approach to providing these services, which involves professional staff, graduate students, and student volunteers. The focus was on English as an Additional Language (EAL) support and services that he coordinates, including workshops, non-credit courses, and the conversation partners program.&nbsp; He concluded by sharing the results of an evaluative pilot study designed to examine how the current designation “EAL” is understood by the many English language learners who seek help from the Student Learning Commons and the possible implications of this study for how their services are marketed and delivered services to their diverse international and domestic EAL clientele. A lively discussion was held afterwards in which Tim asked the following questions:</p>



<ol>
<li>How do you communicate/market to students what resources exist at the university to assist them to learn English in an academic environment?</li>



<li>How do you identity what gaps exist in your support (if any) for students and how do you fill those gaps?</li>



<li>What supports and services have students initiated (if any) that you have built for them?</li>
</ol>



<p>How do you foster interdisciplinary collaborations with Faculties and Units?</p>

<p><strong>Date:&nbsp; Friday, 25 Nov 2016</strong><br><strong>Speakers: HKU, PolyU and CityU OPTIMUS Team – David Gardner, Ken Lau, Kevin Pat, Jovi Chan, James King, Jane Robbins, Hebe Wong</strong></p>



<p>For this HASALD gathering, all of the OPTIMUS Team were in attendance to present and discuss this new online project. The team shared the main goal of the&nbsp;<em>Online Project for the Improvement of University Speaking</em>&nbsp;Project (OPTIMUS) of providing Hong Kong tertiary students with an online, self-access resource for the improvement of their English speaking skills and related that OPTIMUS is the product of a large UGC-funded project conducted collaboratively by HKU, CityU and PolyU. OPTIMUS is centred on a database of more than 60 video exemplars of authentic best-practice speaking from expert and peer presenters. The user interface allows learners a large degree of independence to tailor usage to their preferred learning styles and needs. From this presentation participants learned about the key pedagogical features of the project and also discussed some of the logistical hurdles. The user interface was also demonstrated and its potential applications in self-access learning were also discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Date:&nbsp; Thursday, 7th May 2015</strong><br><strong>Speakers: SHEN Jiayu</strong><br><strong>Topic:&nbsp;Evaluating the Usefulness of Writing Materials in Self-access Language Learning from the Learners’ Perspective</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>



<p>Self-access language learning (SALL) promotes learner autonomy and cultivates life-long learners. Due to the commercially-bought self-access materials housed at the City U Self Access Centre (SAC), their usefulness to SALL is not assured. Hence, there is a need to evaluate materials, especially writing materials due to the increasingly importance of writing in university study. This study explored students’ perceptions of and attitudes towards the SALL writing materials and the City U SAC. The results of a qualitative and quantitative study of 32 student users will be presented, as well as the implications of the findings regarding the SALL materials.</p>



<p><strong>Speaker’s bio:</strong></p>



<p>SHEN Jiayu is a postgraduate student at the City University of Hong Kong. Her major is English Studies. She recently finished her Master’s thesis and was supervised by Dr. Lindsay Miller. Her work is similar to a pilot study done on the SALL materials housed in City U’s SAC. She chose this topic because of her vast experience with self-access learning and use of SAC materials while studying for her Bachelor’s degree.</p>

<p><strong>Date:&nbsp; Tuesday, 17th March 2015</strong><br><strong>Speakers: Thomas Hayward</strong><br><strong>Topic:&nbsp;Study abroad and its implications for self access practices: An overview of relevant research</strong></p>



<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>



<p>This presentation provides an overview of study abroad (SA) research, looking at how the studies are conceived and their overall aims. This research has traditionally been informed by issues in the wider field of second language acquisition, and the central focus has been on proficiency outcomes and why there is such variance between learners. There have been a number of theories devised to account for this outcome, some focusing on learner-internal variables and others looking at contextual factors that can play a role in the amount of language a sojourner ultimately acquires while abroad. These various research approaches will be discussed, and then relevant lessons will be drawn for how self access can help prepare sojourners for their study abroad experience.</p>



<p><strong>Speaker’s bio:</strong></p>



<p>Thomas Hayward is a final-year PhD candidate in the English Department of City U. His thesis is an ethnographic case study of the internationalization practices of a Taiwanese university, and he is using a discourse analysis framework to determine where agency exists in the implementation of internationalization policy at the micro-contextual level. More broadly, he has an interest in second language identities and learner autonomy, particularly in study abroad contexts. An American citizen by birth, Mr. Hayward has lived and worked in several countries in Europe and East Asia.</p>

<p>This presentation is an introduction to the Self-Access Language Learning Center at Mae Fah Luang University, in terms of its infrastructure, management, extra-curricular activities, teacher and learner beliefs, participation, and involvement, learning materials and evaluation. Having been established for over 10 years, MFU’s SALLC has benefitted from a number of particular opportunities that have facilitated the development of the Center. However, the Center has not gone without challenges. The presentation focuses on each of these aspects through the eyes of SALLC staff as they reflect on their working experience. Future plans and projects are also outlined.</p>

<p><strong>Date: Wednesday, 8th October</strong> <strong>2014</strong><br><strong>Speaker: Lindsay Miller</strong><br><strong>Topic: Sustained content and progressive pedagogies: engaging students in their learning.</strong></p>



<p>This talk investigates a novel approach to engaging second language learners in improving their language proficiency. A university level General Education course, which uses Sports Communication as sustained content, is examined. The course uses a progressive pedagogy by way of content-based instruction to integrate vertical and horizontal learning that encourages learner autonomy as a way for students to become critically engaged with their language learning. Typical learners’ feedback about the course, from the linguistic, content and pedagogical perspectives, is presented.</p>
