<p><strong>Data-Driven Learning in an EFL Writing Class: What an Experimental Study Has Revealed</strong></p>



<p>By Professor Guangwei Hu<br>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</p>



<p>More and more linguistic corpora are publicly available today. They are potentially curricular resources that can provide teachers with pedagogical options, offer learners access to authentic language data, facilitate student-centered and discovery-based learning, and consequently foster learner engagement and agency. The adoption of corpus data in the language classroom as teaching and learning resources is known as data-driven learning (DDL). In direct DDL, learners engage in computer-based activities, using corpora and concordancing software to carry out their learning activities, whereas in indirect DDL learners capitalize on corpus data indirectly through corpus-informed, paper-based activities and materials prepared in advance by their teachers. In this talk, I will give an overview of research on DDL and report on a study that set out to investigate and compare the effectiveness of a direct and an indirect approach to DDL in the teaching and learning of hedges. Based on the empirical results obtained (i.e., participants’ mastery of hedges and perceptions of the two DDL approaches), I will discuss pedagogical implications for EFL classrooms and make recommendations for future DDL research.</p>



<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>



<p>Professor Guangwei Hu is an applied linguist by training and specializes in language and literacy education. His research consists of three related strands. The first strand centers on second language literacy education in English-as-a-foreign-language contexts and has its roots in his PhD work, which was situated at the intersection of psycholinguistics, language acquisition, and second language writing. The second strand investigates biliteracy acquisition in bilingual and English-as-a-second-language (ESL) contexts, especially such biliteracy development in the early years. His third strand of inquiry focuses on academic literacy. In this work, he has drawn on various linguistic and epistemological theories to examine how knowledge-making practices and social relations may shape the rhetorical and discourse strategies used by members of academic communities to construct and communicate scientific knowledge. His research on academic literacy aims to capture the diversity and complexity of academic literacy practices and offer pedagogical insights and strategies for enhancing the disciplinary literacy of students at various levels of education.</p>

<p><strong>“Asking is faster than skimming”: AI-powered tools and what they mean for academic reading</strong> </p>



<p>By Dr Svetlana Chigaeva-Heddad </p>



<p>Assistant Professor / English Team Leader </p>



<p>Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong </p>



<p>The main aim of this session is to engage participants in discussing the impact of genAI tools on our understanding of academic literacy and the ways we have been training students to become literate in the discourses of their chosen academic disciplines. The presentation will start by situating the conversation within the latest research on academic reading, a significant yet rather invisible and under-investigated activity that our students are expected to engage in on a regular basis. The review will cover several key conceptualisations of academic reading, ranging from reading as the mental processes needed to decode and comprehend texts to reading as a socio-political activity. The second part of the presentation will focus on the recent academic reading and research support workshops organised for undergraduate students by a self-access learning centre at a private tertiary institution in Hong Kong. The workshops introduced students to a number of AI-powered academic search assistants such as SciSpace and Consensus and AI-powered reading assistants such as Humata and Unriddle. The affordances and constraints of these tools will be then analysed with respect to the key areas highlighted in the literature review.</p>



<p>The session is expected to be of value to academic literacy curriculum and programme developers, managers, as well as teachers across disciplines interested in integrating AI-powered reading and research tools into their lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Evolution of portfolio assessment:&nbsp;A focus on its transition, integration, research trends, and implications</strong> </p>



<p>By Dr Ricky Lam</p>



<p>Portfolio assessment has been widely adopted in general and English as a second language education for nearly four decades. Despite its significance and popularity, practitioners and scholars alike remain dubious about its usefulness, practicality, and reliability to be applied as an alternative in assessments. To dispel stakeholders’ ambiguities and scepticisms, this paper critically surveys four key domains of portfolio assessment, which could equip frontline practitioners and assessment researchers with additional instructional repertoires for upgrading instruction and cutting-edge research agendas for conducting portfolio-related studies, respectively. These four domains entail: (1) affordances and challenges when print-based portfolio programs transition into electronic ones within multiple settings; (2) applications of tried-and-tested strategies to facilitate portfolio integration into English curricula; (3) systematic reviews that unpack future research agendas to make original contributions to portfolio assessment scholarship; and (4) a cautionary note that alerts aspiring teachers and scholars when (e-)Portfolio assessment is utilized for teaching and research in a wider English as a second language context. The key takeaways from the paper are twofold, providing audience members with (i) a renewed perspective of how they can effectively conduct and research portfolio assessment in the post-pandemic era, and (ii) up-to-date and practical resources, for instance, blurbs on common e-Portfolio tools, portfolio application websites, selected bibliography (journal articles and monographs), and online tutorials about e-Portfolio set-up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Secondary and online effects for structured input: Current and future research trends</strong> </p>



<p>By Professor Alessandro G. Benati </p>



<p>Processing instruction is a type of pedagogical intervention which is effective in assisting L2 learners in the correct processing and interpretation of linguistic features in the input. The primary effects of processing instruction have been measured in several studies investigating different linguistic features, languages, processing problems across different populations, and demographics such as age, motivation, aptitude, working memory capacity, and first language of L2 learners. The main results from these studies have clearly and consistently demonstrated that L2 learners exposed to structured input activities (the main component of processing instruction) develop competence in processing input accurately, in terms of interpretation at the sentence and discourse levels, and in producing language containing the target feature both orally and in writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This talk explores a new line of research into possible transfer-of primary online effects of structured input. Secondary effects are measured when two linguistic items under focus present L2 learners with a similar processing problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, word final morphology such as present tense –<em>s</em>&nbsp;and past tense –<em>ed</em>&nbsp;in English present L2 learners will be: Will learners who receive training on one type of processing strategy for one specific form appropriately transfer the use of that strategy to other forms without further instruction? Up to now, empirical research measuring secondary effects have used pencil-and-paper offline tests. However, offline tests might not provide the most appropriate measure of L2 learners’ internal language processing. Using online measurements such as self-paced reading speed or eye-tracking might provide a more valid metric to capture L2 learners’ internal in-depth processing and underlying implicit knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>About the speaker</strong></p>



<p><em>Alessandro G. Benati</em>&nbsp;is Professor and Head of the School of Education at University College Dublin in Ireland, and honorary/visiting professor at the University of York, Hong Kong, Macquarie, and Anaheim. His work has focused on language processing. Within this area, three general questions have guided his research: (i) what kinds of linguistic cues do second language learners use to understand sentences during language comprehension? (ii) how do experimental methodologies in language processing impact study outcomes and theory development? (iii) how can insights on second language processing improve instructed language learning? More recently, he has applied eye-tracking methodology to issues of processing language in instructed second language acquisition contexts. His work has appeared in&nbsp;<em>Second Language Research</em>,&nbsp;<em>Language Teaching Research, System, Language Awareness, Ampersand, IRAL, ISLA, Language Teaching, Applied Psycholinguistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Navigating the Future of Language Education: From Generative AI to Cyber-Physical Learning</strong> </p>



<p>By Dr Sean McMinn</p>



<p>In a world marked by technological advancement and societal transformation, practitioners of language education are experiencing challenges to how, what, and why we teach and assess languages. For example, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, not only have the potential to disrupt how we teach languages, but also how we might facilitate self-access learning. As we navigate these changes, a critical consideration arises: Should language education be value-based, competency-based, proficiency-based, or a harmonious combination of these? This fundamental question guides the pursuit of pedagogical innovation, influencing the design and delivery of educational experiences. And with these new innovations comes the need for educators to think about new processes and strategies. This talk will explore the essence of innovation in language education, transcending traditional boundaries to consider new approaches to teaching and learning, while being mindful of how technologies are also influencing self-regulatory learning strategies. A particular focus is placed on the emergence of Generative AI, a groundbreaking development that offers opportunities for creativity, personalisation, and engagement within the learning process, but also comes with ethical and equity implications. Cyber-Physical Learning (CPL) is also highlighted as a holistic design approach that combines pedagogy and technology in disruptive yet efficient ways, seamlessly integrating cyber and physical experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancing Teacher Development Through Free Online Corpora: Advancing Corpus-Based Language Pedagogy (CBLP)</strong> </p>



<p>By Dr Qing Ma (Angel)</p>



<p>While the potential of corpus linguistics to enhance language teaching and learning is significant, its practical application remains largely unexplored within the professional teaching community. This workshop aims to bridge this gap by introducing participants to a selection of freely available online corpora, designed to familiarize language teachers with these valuable resources. Furthermore, participants will learn about an innovative language pedagogy &#8211; Corpus-Based Language Pedagogy (CBLP). Attendees will acquire fundamental knowledge about CBLP and learn how to utilize various corpus tools for both teaching and learning purposes. Ultimately, the goal of this workshop is to empower language teachers/educators to fully harness the potential of CBLP, resulting in more effective classroom instruction and fostering a culture of ongoing self-learning, integral to continuous professional development.</p>

<p><strong>Insights from my learning journey from schoolteacher to being named a top 2% most-cited scholar</strong> </p>



<p>by Dr Benjamin Luke Moorhouse</p>



<p>Transitioning from a professional career to one in academia can be daunting. This is due in part to the high yet sometimes unclear expectations, steep learning curve and ‘publish or perish’ culture of modern higher education. However, academics with previous professional careers can enrich higher education. They bring real world experiences and knowledge that can inform teaching and research. In this talk, I share my experience transitioning from schoolteacher to university lecturer and then to assistant professor (my current role). Primarily, I will focus on how I gained the knowledge and skills needed to engage and contribute to the scholarly research community leading to being named a top 2% most-cited scholar in 2022 and 2023 by Stanford University. Through sharing my own learning journey, I hope others will gain valuable insights on how they can contribute to academia.</p>

<p><strong>The Implications and Applications of Large Language Models for Self-Access Language Learning&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>by Professor Andy Curtis</p>



<p>As a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, many hundreds of millions of students and teachers had to move their classes – typically with very little time and limited institutional support (if any) – from being physically in-person and in bricks-and-mortar classrooms to everything-online, all-the-time, with no possibility of blended learning. However, in spite of the institutional, income-driven mishandling of that move (Curtis, 2023) many useful lessons are emerging regarding independent, self-directed, online education, including foreign language teaching and learning. Then, just as many countries were coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of 2022, the OpenAI corporation released the first publicly available version of the software application, ChatGPT, which garnered 100 million users within its first two months, making it the fastest growing consumer app in history. In this talk, we will, then, look at the implications and applications of such apps for independent, self-directed foreign language learning.</p>

<p><strong>Date:&nbsp; Thursday, 25 May 2017</strong><br><strong>Speakers: Timothy Mossman from Simon Fraser University</strong></p>



<p>This was an overview of the services the SLC at SFU provides to shape student success: workshops, consultations, print and online resources, as well as through classroom collaborations with faculty.&nbsp; Tim described their unique multi-tiered approach to providing these services, which involves professional staff, graduate students, and student volunteers. The focus was on English as an Additional Language (EAL) support and services that he coordinates, including workshops, non-credit courses, and the conversation partners program.&nbsp; He concluded by sharing the results of an evaluative pilot study designed to examine how the current designation “EAL” is understood by the many English language learners who seek help from the Student Learning Commons and the possible implications of this study for how their services are marketed and delivered services to their diverse international and domestic EAL clientele. A lively discussion was held afterwards in which Tim asked the following questions:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>How do you communicate/market to students what resources exist at the university to assist them to learn English in an academic environment?</li>



<li>How do you identity what gaps exist in your support (if any) for students and how do you fill those gaps?</li>



<li>What supports and services have students initiated (if any) that you have built for them?</li>
</ol>



<p>How do you foster interdisciplinary collaborations with Faculties and Units?</p>
